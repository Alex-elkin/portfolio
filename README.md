Description

SpaceGame is a 2D arcade-style space shooter made in Processing where the player pilots a spaceship that follows the mouse and shoots lasers by clicking to destroy falling rocks while collecting power-ups and avoiding collisions. The game begins on a start screen and transitions into fast-paced gameplay featuring randomly generated asteroids of varying sizes and speeds, drifting stars for a scrolling background, and collectible power-ups that boost health, add turrets, or increase ammo. The spaceship can fire multiple lasers depending on its turret count, and each collision or missed rock affects the player’s score, health, and level progression. As more rocks are avoided or destroyed, the game becomes harder with quicker asteroid spawns, while background music and sound effects like “laser,” “explosion,” and “game over” enhance the experience. The game ends when the ship’s health reaches zero, displaying a “Game Over” message and halting the action, rewarding players for surviving and scoring as high as possible in this dynamic space survival challenge.
