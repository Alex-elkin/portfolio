## The pit of despair

![Lavar](https://github.com/Alex-elkin/portfolio/blob/main/lavar.png)

The pit of despair is a platformer game with 3 bosses. I was in charge of one of the bosses, lavar. His abilities included lava waves, meteors, and meteor rains. He has a 2nd phase which is a lot harder in difficulty.
